        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We recommend professional roof cleaning every 2-3 years, depending on your location and the amount of organic growth. Properties in areas with high rainfall and humidity may need more frequent cleaning to prevent moss and algae buildup. Regular cleaning helps maintain your roof's condition and appearance."
